## üöÄ Overview framework
![VARSR](figure/framework.png)
Image Super-Resolution (ISR) has seen significant progress with the introduction of remarkable generative models. However, challenges such as the trade-off issues between fidelity and realism, as well as computational complexity, have also posed limitations on their application. Building upon the tremendous success of autoregressive models in the language domain, we propose \textbf{VARSR}, a novel visual autoregressive modeling for ISR framework with the form of next-scale prediction. To effectively integrate and preserve semantic information in low-resolution images, we propose using prefix tokens to incorporate the condition. Scale-aligned Rotary Positional Encodings are introduced to capture spatial structures and the diffusion refiner is utilized for modeling quantization residual loss to achieve pixel-level fidelity. Image-based Classifier-free Guidance is proposed to guide the generation of more realistic images. Furthermore, we collect large-scale data and design a training process to obtain robust generative priors. Quantitative and qualitative results show that VARSR is capable of generating high-fidelity and high-realism images with more efficiency than diffusion-based methods.


## üöÄ Results
![VARSR](figure/results.png)


## üî•Installation
```
## git clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/qyp2000/VARSR.git
cd VARSR

# create an environment with python >= 3.9
conda create -n varsr python=3.9
conda activate varsr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üî•Inference
#### Step 1: Download the pretrained models and test data
- Download VARSR and VQVAE model from <a href='https://huggingface.co/qyp2000/VARSR'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Huggingface-qyp2000/VARSR-yellow'></a> and put it into ``checkpoints/``.
- Prepare testing LR images in the `testset`, e.g., `testset/{folder_path}/LR`.

#### Step 2: Run code
- To generate standard 512*512 images:
```
python test_varsr.py
```
You can modify the parameters to adapt to your specific need, such as the `cfg` which is set to 6.0 by default.

- To generate high-resolution images:
```
python test_tile.py
```
You can modify the parameters to adapt to your specific need, such as the `cfg` which is set to 7.0 by default and the `super-resolution scale` which is set to 4.0 by default.


## üî• Train 

#### Step1: Download the pretrained models and training data
- Download VQVAE model from <a href='https://huggingface.co/qyp2000/VARSR'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Huggingface-qyp2000/VARSR-yellow'></a> and put it into ``checkpoints/``.
- Download pretrained original VAR models from [VAR](https://github.com/FoundationVision/VAR) and put them into ``checkpoints/``. You can also use the C2I VARSR pretrained on our large-scale dataset, which can be downloaded from <a href='https://huggingface.co/qyp2000/VARSR'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Huggingface-qyp2000/VARSR-yellow'></a>.
- Prepare your own training images into `trainset`, e.g., `trainset/{folder_path}`. And you can put your negative samples into `trainset_neg`, e.g., `trainset_neg/{folder_path}`. More changes to the dataset path can be done in the file `dataloader/localdataset_lpm.py`.

#### Step2: Run code
```
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 train.py --depth=24 --batch_size=4 --ep=5 --fp16=1 --tblr=5e-5 --alng=1e-4 --wpe=0.01 --wandb_flag=True --fuse=0 --exp_name='VARSR'
```
You can modify the parameters in `utils/arg_util.py` to adapt to your specific need, such as the `batch_size` and the `learning_rate`.


## üî•Class-to-Image Inference
We also provide pretrained Class-to-Image model weights and inference code to contribute more to the academic community.

#### Step 1: Download the pretrained models
- Download the C2I VARSR pretrained on our large-scale dataset, which can be downloaded from <a href='https://huggingface.co/qyp2000/VARSR'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Huggingface-qyp2000/VARSR-yellow'></a>.

#### Step 2: Run code
```
python test_C2I.py
```
Our dataset contains 3830 semantic categories, and you can adjust the `classes` to generate images corresponding to each category.
